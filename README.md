# Robotoff DB seeder

> **Motivation**: seed a local Robotoff instance's database from JSON data obtained from the production instance

## Setup

* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Copy `.env.sample` as `.env`
* Your local Robotoff instance must be up and running (See [Robotoff's README](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff#installation) for Docker Compose instructions)
